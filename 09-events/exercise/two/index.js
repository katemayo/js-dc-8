/*

Writing event handlers
Do Independently, then review together

1. Get the h1 element from the page and save it to a variable called myCounter
2. Declare a variable called counterIndex and set it equal to 0
3. When the page has loaded, set the text of our header to the current value of our counter variable, so the final html is: "<h1>Counter: 0</h1>"
4. Add an event listener to the button on the page so that when it is clicked, the value of counterIndex is incremented by 1 and the new value is added to the page
