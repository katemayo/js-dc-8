let suits = ['hearts', 'clubs', 'spades', 'diamonds']
let ranks = ['ace', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine', 'ten', 'jack', 'queen', 'king']

// Given the above suits and ranks array, write a function called
// createDeck that will take both as parameters and return a new array
// with all 52 possible card combinations. The returned 'Deck of Cards'
// should be an array with 52 strings in it, each representing a card
// (i.e. 'ace of Hearts')

// Call createDeck and save the result into a variable called
// deckOfCards.

// Write a function called getRandomCard that will return one random
// card from deckOfCards whenever it is called.
