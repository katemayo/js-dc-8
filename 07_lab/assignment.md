# Freshen up on `html` and `css`
If you do not know any `html` or `css` or if you have very limited exposure to these technologies, I highly recommend that you brush up on them. Here are some resources for you to do that. Pick the one that you think is easiest for you to follow and learn from.
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)
- [Learn to Code HTML and CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
- [HTML Introduction](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
- [CSS Introduction](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)

# Review
The following is suggested reading for you, if you'd like to review any of the material we've covered in the first part of the course.

I recommend that you finish it before next class, when we start Part 2 of this course. By no means is any of this *assigned*, it's for your own interest and education.

In particular, these chapters for review:

1. Values, Types, and Operators
2. Program Structure
3. Functions

These chapters for a little more depth
