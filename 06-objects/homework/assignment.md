# Review
The following is suggested reading for you, if you'd like to review any of the material we've covered in the first part of the course.

I recommend that you finish it before next Tuesday's class, when we start our first lab. By no means is any of this *assigned*, it's for your own interest and education.

These chapters in particular for review:

1. Values, Types, and Operators
