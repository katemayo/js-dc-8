// 1) Write a function that generates a random number between 1 and a max number, which will be a parameter

// 2) Write a function that rolls a 20 sided die (using the function from #1).
//    If the number is greater than 15, roll a two six sided dice. Use the total and subtract that from the monster's health.
//    Do this until the monster is dead.
