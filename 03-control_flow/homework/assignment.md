1. 99 Bottles of Beer
2. Fizz Buzz

**99 Bottles of Beer** (bottles.js)
Write a script that logs to the console the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" in the terminal. If you're unfamiliar with the song, you can [find the lyrics here](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html). Make sure your program can handle both singular and plural cases (i.e. both "100 bottles of beer" and "1 bottle of beer").

**Fizz Buzz** (fizzbuzz.js)
Fizz buzz is literally the most fun game you'll ever play in your entire life! The rules are simple: set a ceiling, which is as high as you will count, and start counting up from 1. As you count up, replace any number that is a multiple of 3 with `fizz` and any number that is a multiple of 5 with `buzz`. Repeat until you reach your ceiling. So, if our ceiling were 20, we'd get the following: `1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, buzz, fizz, 17, fizz, 19, 20`

*Bonus:* replace any number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5 with `fizzbuzz`.
